-----------------------------------------


## Requirements and Setup ##

To install clone the repo, move to the folder and `yarn install`

Afterwards, open the `template.env` file and change the variables to your own.

Finally `yarn start` and test it on your own discord server.

The node-cron requires 100% uptime for this to work well.
